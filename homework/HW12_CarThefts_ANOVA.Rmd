## Introduction

This analysis examines the impact of a significant spike in car theft rates in 2023 in Prince George's County, and whether that spike has led to a sustained higher rate of car theft in the county. We'll use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine if theft rates differ significantly between pre-spike (before 2023), spike (2023), and post-spike (2024-present) periods.

## Data Preparation and Exploration

### Loading Libraries and Data

```{r load-libraries}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r load-data}
# Import data
theft_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/car_thefts_month17_25.csv")

# Look at the first few rows
head(theft_data)

# Get a summary of the data
summary(theft_data)
```


### Get the data how we want it and calculate the rates

**Task 1** Replace REPLACE_ME with the variables you need to calculate the theft_rate (2 points)

```{r process-data}
# Calculate theft rate and create time period variable
theft_data <- theft_data |>
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(month),
    year = year(date),
    month_number = month(date),
    theft_rate = (total/population) * 100000,
    time_period = case_when(
      year < 2023 ~ "Pre-spike",
      year == 2023 ~ "Spike year",
      year > 2023 ~ "Post-spike"
    )
  )

# Create summary by time period
period_summary <- theft_data |>
  group_by(time_period) |>
  summarize(
    mean_thefts = mean(total),
    mean_rate = mean(theft_rate),
    median_rate = median(theft_rate),
    sd_rate = sd(theft_rate),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Display the summary
knitr::kable(period_summary, digits = 2,
             caption = "Summary of Car Theft Rates by Time Period")
```

**Task 2** Describe the results of calculating the rates for each period. What do they suggest? (3 points)

Before 2023, the theft rate was pretty low and it more than doubled in 2023. After 2023, it dipped back down again to 43 thefts per month per 100000 people. This does suggest that there was a spike since the rate increased a lot and then decreased. It would be more obvious though with a graph rather than just the numbers.

## Visualizing the Spike Pattern

### Time Series Plot

```{r time-series}
# Time series plot showing the spike pattern
ggplot(theft_data, aes(x = date, y = theft_rate)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.2, color = "hotpink") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2023-01-01"), linetype = "dashed", color = "hotpink") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2024-01-01"), linetype = "dashed", color = "hotpink") +
  annotate("text", x = as.Date("2023-07-01"), y = max(theft_data$theft_rate) * 0.9, 
           label = "Spike Year", color = "hotpink") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Car Theft Rates (2017-2025) with Spike Highlighted",
       x = "Date", y = "Thefts per 100,000 Population") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Task 3** Describe the output of this chart and then give it a better, more active title that provides the lede (3 points)

The chart shows the rate of car thefts per 100,000 people in Prince George's County each month from 2017 to 2025 and highlights a spike that occurred in 2023. It also shows how the theft rate was pretty consistent from 2017 to 2022.



2023 sees spike in car thefts

Car thefts in Prince George's County have been fairly steady over the past eight years. In 2023, that quickly changed. 

The year saw car thefts more than double across the county. While the numbers have started to fall, cars are still being swiped almost twice as much as they had just a few years before.



Now let's take a look at average theft rates.

### Yearly Average Theft Rates

```{r yearly-means}
# Calculate yearly means
yearly_means <- theft_data |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rate = mean(theft_rate),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Plot yearly means
ggplot(yearly_means, aes(x = year, y = mean_rate)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, color = "pink") +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "pink") +
  geom_point(data = yearly_means |> filter(year == 2023), 
             aes(x = year, y = mean_rate), size = 5, color = "hotpink") +
  labs(title = "Average Annual Car Theft Rates",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Thefts per 100,000 Population") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2017:2025)
```

## One-way ANOVA Analysis

### Hypothesis Formulation

For our ANOVA test, we'll compare the mean theft rates between the three time periods. First we need to create our hypotheses.

**Task 4** Fill in the hypotheses (2 points)

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference between the three time periods.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference between the three time periods.


### One-way ANOVA Test

```{r anova-test}
# Perform one-way ANOVA on theft rates by time period
period_anova <- aov(theft_rate ~ time_period, data = theft_data)
summary(period_anova)
```

**Task 5** Describe the result: are there real differences in the average rates between the time periods? Is this result significant? (5 points)

Since the F-value is very large it means that there is a large difference between the mean car theft rates. The p-value is also much less than 0.05 which means that the difference in significant and we reject the null hypothesis. This shows that there is a significant difference between the three time periods.

## Compare the differences between specific periods

Run our post-anova Tukey test and examine the results. 

```{r posthoc}
# Tukey's HSD test
tukey_results <- TukeyHSD(period_anova)
print(tukey_results)
```


```{r period-means}
# Visualize time period means with confidence intervals
period_rates <- theft_data |>
  group_by(time_period) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rate = mean(theft_rate),
    se = sd(theft_rate) / sqrt(n()),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    lower_ci = mean_rate - qt(0.975, n() - 1) * se,
    upper_ci = mean_rate + qt(0.975, n() - 1) * se
  )

# Ensure time period is ordered correctly
period_rates$time_period <- factor(period_rates$time_period, 
                                   levels = c("Pre-spike", "Spike year", "Post-spike"))

ggplot(period_rates, aes(x = time_period, y = mean_rate, fill = time_period)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Car Theft Rates by Time Period with 95% Confidence Intervals",
       x = "", y = "Mean Theft Rate per 100,000") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Conclusion

This analysis has examined whether there are significant differences in car theft rates between the pre-spike period (before 2023), the spike year (2023), and the post-spike period (after 2023).

**Task 6** Describe the results of the Tukey's test and chart showing confidence intervals. Is there a significant difference between the three periods? In particular, is the difference between the pre-spike and post-spike periods real and significant? Write a headline and lede reporting these findings, focusing on the pre- and post-spike periods. (5 points)

The Tukey's test shows that there is a real and significant difference between the three periods, even the difference between the pre-spike and post-spike periods. The post-spike theft rate is almost doubled those before the spike.



2023 sees spike in car thefts

Car thefts in Prince George's County have been fairly steady over the past eight years. Since 2023, that trend has become more turbulent 

That year saw car thefts more than double across the county. While the numbers have started to fall, cars are still being swiped almost twice as much as they had just a few years before.
